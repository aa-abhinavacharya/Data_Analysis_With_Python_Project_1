# Project :- Maven MegaMart Acquisition Analysis

### Project Brief :- Maven MegaMart is currently exploring the acquisition of another retail company as part of a strategic initiative to expand its market share. This potential acquisition has reached the due diligence phase, during which several datasets related to the target company's customer behavior and sales performance have been provided.

### Objective Brief :- You have been selected to lead the in-depth analysis, which will be presented to senior management. Your role is critical in uncovering insights from the provided data that will support decision-making during the acquisition process.

### Objectives :- 

1.Import data from multiple CSV files.

2.Conduct exploratory analysis on large-scale datasets (millions of rows).

3.Generate additional columns to support deeper analysis.

4.Apply filtering, sorting, and aggregation techniques to identify and summarize critical information.

5.Build plots to communicate key insights

## How the insights help us in decision making for acquistion

#### Overall Statistic :-  Business Health Check

These metrics provide a macro-level understanding of the target company's performance:

1. Total Sales (SALES_VALUE):
Gives a sense of the revenue scale. A high number may indicate strong customer demand or high transaction volume — both are good signs when expanding market share.

2. Total Discount & % Discount:
Shows pricing strategy and margin pressure. A very high discount rate may signal aggressive pricing or an attempt to clear excess inventory — which might be a risk.

3. Total Quantity Sold & Max Quantity per Row:
High quantity indicates volume movement. Reviewing outlier rows helps assess if high sales are due to bulk-buying, deep discounting, or genuinely popular products.

4. Sales Value per Basket / per Household:
These are key indicators of customer spending habits and basket size, helping evaluate customer quality and LTV (lifetime value). Larger average baskets could mean better customer loyalty or more effective product bundling.

#### Household Analysis — Customer Insights

Helps evaluate the customer base of the target company:

1. Distribution of Household Spend: Tells you whether revenue is driven by many small spenders or a few large ones. A healthy distribution shows diversified risk and better market penetration.

2. Top 10 Households by Quantity / Sales: Identifies power users or loyal customers — extremely valuable in retail. Their behavior can also indicate the types of products or promotions that drive loyalty.

3. Visualizing Top 10 Households' Spend: Helps stakeholders easily grasp who the key customers are, which can inform retention strategies or targeted campaigns post-acquisition.

#### Product Analysis — Portfolio Strength

Supports product-level decision making for post-acquisition growth:

1. Top-Selling Products by Value: Highlights bestsellers that are driving the business. These can become focus products in a wider portfolio post-merger.

2. Discount Rate of Top Sellers: If bestsellers are only moving due to heavy discounting, there may be a profitability issue.

3. Top 10 Products (Name Lookup): Brings clarity to what’s actually driving sales — are these essential goods, seasonal products, or niche items?

4. Most Common Product in Top Households: Shows which products top customers love, possibly good candidates for cross-selling or featuring in other markets.

5. Highest Quantity in a Single Row (Name Lookup): Helps verify if the outlier is a genuine product trend or a one-off (e.g., bulk promo or reseller behavior).

###  How This Helps the Acquisition Decision?

1. Revenue Potential: Confirms whether the target company is generating enough volume/value to justify the acquisition cost.

2. Customer Base Quality: A diverse, loyal customer base reduces risk and increases cross-selling opportunities post-acquisition.

3. Product Fit: If top products complement your own offerings, it strengthens the case for strategic synergy.

4. Operational Red Flags: High discounts, revenue concentration in few households, or excessive reliance on a few products might be red flags for sustainability.
